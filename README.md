# My-Employee
Mini Project of Simple Employee Information System

## Technical Stack
The application is built using a functional full-stack architecture. The Backend is powered by PHP LARAVEL, handling server-side logic and seamless data management.

The Frontend is the core focus of this project, featuring a professional Dashboard Layouting built with Bootstrap for a fully responsive grid system. A key highlight is the implementation of Vanilla JavaScript to enhance user interactivity, including:

Real-time DOM Updates: Dynamic clock and date integration synchronized with Jakarta’s timezone.

State Persistence: Utilizing localStorage to maintain active navigation and profile tab states across page refreshes.

Interactive UI/UX: Responsive component management, including custom hover transitions, modal triggers, and seamless tab-switching logic.
